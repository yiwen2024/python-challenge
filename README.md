# python-challenge
>Two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll were completed in this assignment. Through this assignment, I learned and practised reading csv files and writing results in text file.

>PyBank Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

>PyPoll Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote

>Acknowledgement
 For PyBnak challenge, I referred the script of SYU2017 /Python-Challenge on Git Hub. 
 For PyPoll challenge, I referred the script of Farzad Khatoonabadi / python-challenge on Git Hub.
 As a beginner of coding, referring those online resources helped me to better understand the structure and language of Python coding. Baed on the understanding, I 
 was able to put comments and modify the script. Also, the team of AskBCS learning assistant provided great support of trouble shooting on my assigment.

>In addition to practicing Paython coding, I learned how to Push these changes to GitHub
